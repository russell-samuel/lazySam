A collection of Shell scripts that helping to do first-principle calculations. 

# A story (Warrior vs. Dragon version)
Long long time ago, a boy, who was doing first-priciple calculation, suddenly realized that he is doing some reduplicative and fussy jobs. 
He got tired about it and decided to make the change that's when he wrote his first Shell script. 
As time passed by, the script folder is growing, and will keep on growing...

# Disclaimer
